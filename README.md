This is my personal website built in Node JS. It is the second iteration of my personal web page. This version is not affiliated with the first version as the first version was not build with the same technology and unscalable.

## Technology Used
  - Node.js
  - Express framework
  - Angular jS
  - Database (type still undecided)
